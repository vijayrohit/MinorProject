This paper deals with the design and implementation of Raspberry pi based IOT 
concept it means internet of things. 

In this present generation everything is going on internet itself. So in this project we concentrate totally on the present generation. Life how they can get security to their 
home or office and control the devices by using android app just by using internet in 
their smart phones.

Raspberry pi acts like a small minicomputer it is totally a Linux platform. By just 
connecting mouse and keyboard we can operate it as minicomputer where we can play 
games, play videos etc. just like our personal laptop work. And also the WI-FI module 
is used in this project to control the devices from remote location also by getting the 
status of the devices into smart phone android app everything is going on internet 
itself our day to day life. Future generation will work on internet itself by sitting in 
one place we can do anything on internet.
